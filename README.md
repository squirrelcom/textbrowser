This file is designed for use from the command line.

* Save `requirements.txt` and `textbrowser.py` to a folder.
* Navigate to that folder.
* Launch command line/terminal
* Check if you have packages `bs4`, `requests` and `colorama` installed separately (all three are listed in requirements.txt):
* `pip show requests`
* `pip show bs4`
* `pip show colorama`
* If there's warning for all of these packages, install them with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Alternatively, install only the unavailable ones with `pip install modulename` where modulename is colorama for example.

* Watch `textbrowser.gif` for a short intro.

Now type: `python textbrowser.py`
